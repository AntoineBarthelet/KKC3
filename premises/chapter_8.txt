Kvothe wanders in the forest with barely enough to eat for months. He's obsessed with playing his father's lute, one of the only personal possessions he left with. When the lute's strings begin to break, Kvothe travels to a city called Tarbean to hunt for replacements. He stays in Tarbean, continues to nearly starve, and has run-ins with local children. He also experiences small kindnesses from strangers here and there.
