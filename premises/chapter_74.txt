The man also mentions seeing blue lights in the forest two nights ago, the night before the wedding. Kvothe and Denna go back to the property to set up camp for the night. They end up at a high point on the property and see blue lights in the distance for themselves. As they talk about the possibility of Chandrian involvement, they piece together a likely scenario. The land owner must've dug up something of importance to the Chandrian, and they must've attacked during the wedding because that would wipe away anyone close to the man, that is, anyone who might have knowledge of his discovery. Just like they did with the Edema Ruh, the Chandrian made sure there were no survivors with unwanted knowledge of them.
