Kvothe and Denna go out to Barrow Hill to investigate and to look for a few items she left behind. She claims the fire was blue (aka magic fire), but the damage is so devastating that it triggers something in Kvothe's mind. The remains of the house look very much like the remains of the Edema Ruh when his parents were murdered all those years ago. Kvothe pairs this knowledge with that of a pig herder with whom they share a meal in the forest. He decides it's likely the Chandrian were involved.
