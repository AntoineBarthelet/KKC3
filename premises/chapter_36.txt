Kvothe takes a trip to the crockery with Elodin, who he wishes would be his patron. Elodin begins to test him, at one point tempting him to jump off the balcony and trust he'll help Kvothe land softly. He also says he'll answer three questions, the third of which Kvothe uses to ask Elodin to be his patron. Elodin won't, so Kvothe ends up studying at the Medica and working at the Artificery (Fishery) instead.
