Kvothe leaves those lined up to praise him to hunt for his Aloine, the haunting voice that joined him from the crowd during the song. He wasn't able to find her in the crowd. He's almost given up hope when he runs into Denna. It was her! She doesn't seem to recognize him, so Kvothe acts like he doesn't know her. They have a sweet, playful exchange until Kvothe's friend Savoy comes to claim Denna, his date. Before Kvothe leaves, they exchange names. She says hers is Diane.
