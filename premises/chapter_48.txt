Kvothe decides to play the most difficult song—Savien and Aloine—made even more difficult in that he must rely on a young lady from the audience to join him to round the song out at the end. Despite a string breaking on his lute during his song (because of Ambrose, he suspects), Kvothe is a resounding hit. He earns his talent pipes pin and congratulations from everyone there.
