They investigate their camp in the morning and notice the dragon has eaten many trees and rocks. Kvothe explains the trees are for iron to fortify his scales and the rocks are to help crush and digest his food in his stomach. They continue their journey and come across another destroyed homestead. Denna thinks the damage here is different than that at the wedding, and Kvothe has to agree. They hear something lumbering in the woods nearby and escape to a lookout perched on top of a rock. They shimmy through a crevice and climb the makeshift ladder someone placed there. The dragon approaches and scratches over the claw marks it's already made there.
