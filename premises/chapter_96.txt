Kvothe and Ambrose are both put on trial for their most recent skirmish. They're both found guilty. Ambrose is fined the amount of the lute, which Kvothe lies about. He embellishes the amount he paid for it but receives the full amount as reparations for his broken instrument. The masters vote to expel Kvothe but then immediately vote to rescind the expulsion in a move that was seemingly planned before the trial. He will receive lashes for his punishment instead.
