Kvothe finds the University grounds in the middle of the city, and finally he has a stroke of luck. The day is the last one in which he can apply for entrance for the next year's studies. Kvothe eavesdrops on some of the other applicants and then nails his interview, promptly answering questions from professors of every discipline. He knew the answers to all the questions anyway but knows his tuition will be based on how much he impresses the team of educators: the more impressive Kvothe is, the less his tuition will be. So he eavesdrops to be able to answer quickly because most of the questions are variations of the same ones asked of other applicants.
