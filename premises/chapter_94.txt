When Kvothe finds Wil and Sim nearby, he sits down to visit. They soon notice his lute is missing. Ambrose has stolen it and plays it while he sings a silly verse making fun of Kvothe. Then he tosses the lute to Kvothe. The instrument flies clumsily, and Kvothe can't catch it. It falls to the ground and splinters. Kvothe is beyond angry and suddenly calls a windstorm in a language he doesn't understand. Ambrose's arm ends up broken as a result. Kvothe is out of it afterwards, so Wil and Sim take him to Kilvin. After they explain what's happened, Kilvin talks to Kvothe in a strange language, pulling him out of his stupor. He answers his teacher's question.
