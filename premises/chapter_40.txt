So Kvothe starts telling about his second term at the University. He did well his first term, including on his exams, and he isn't paid to go to school again; this time he's charged three talents. He doesn't have this kind of money, so he has to go to Devi in Imre for a loan. He doesn't want to pay the 50 percent interest every two months and especially doesn't want to leave his blood as collateral. So Kvothe leaves, but then he lusts after a lute in a pawn shop next door. He then goes back for the loan, which will cover tuition and room and board for the semester as well as the cost of the lute.
