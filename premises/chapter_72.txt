As they eat dinner, Kvothe pulls the story of Barrow Hill out of the man. Apparently the father of the bride owned the property on which they held the wedding, and he had been pulling stones out of the ground to build the structures on the property. Locals believed the stones were from underground graves (barrows), but Kvothe knows what a true barrow looks like, and that's not what the stones on the structures looked like. He believes they were brought in from somewhere else and buried there. The man then reveals the father of the bride recently made some big discovery—a treasure of sorts—as he was digging for more stones.
