The dragon finally comes and eats the resin. Nothing happens, and Kvothe is confused. Then he sees another fire in the distance: It's the harvest festival at Trebon. Kvothe knows he has to go there to try to stop the dragon. He makes sure Denna can't roll off of their stone perch in her stupor and heads for the town. Trebon is already ablaze when Kvothe arrives. Using magic several times, he's able to eventually fell the dragon, but he's injured and drained.
