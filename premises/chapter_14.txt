This sparks a memory Kvothe had buried: The Chandrian he'd found in the forest said his parents' acting troupe was murdered because of a song his father was writing. It was taking longer than any other for his father to write, and, with his wife's help, it was going to be his masterpiece. The song must've conveyed some long lost truth about the Chandrian because many people know a part of the Chandrian myth but are never harmed. Kvothe longs to ask Skarpi to tell him what he knows about the Chandrian, but Skarpi is arrested before he gets a chance to ask all of his questions, including those about Lanre, the leader of the Chandrian who Skarpi has referenced.
