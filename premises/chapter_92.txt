Kvothe runs into Denna by chance. Her reaction is different than what he'd expected: She's delighted to see him and asks where in the world he's been. Then he notices she's with another man: Lentaren. He's handsome and charming and obviously wealthy. Kvothe and Denna promise to meet up soon before she departs with Lentaren.
